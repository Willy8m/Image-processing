# Analysis of the paper: A new k out of n secret image sharing scheme in visual cryptography

Visual Cryptography is the technique of sharing an encoded secret image by dividing it up into many shares and distributing them among various participants. It is essential to amass all the shares in order to decrypt the original image.

A k out of n scheme represents a big leap forward in Visual Cryptography, providing versatility and security to older methods. By applying certain conditions and executing XOR operators it is possible to divide the secret image into n shares, while being able to recover the image by superposing an arbitrary subset k of those transparencies.

In this paper we explore Shakar and Swaran's (k,n) technique. Structural and security flaws of the proposed methodology are discussed. In addition, an alternate hypothetical method using Shamir's 1979 paper is discussed.
